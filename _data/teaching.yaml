  description: >-
    Writing-intensive exploration of evolution from population genetics to speciation.
    Students build a polished term paper on a contemporary controversy through scaffolded
    assignments, peer review, and 1–2 required one-on-one meetings. Emphasis on interpreting
    primary literature and real datasets; honors students design classroom lessons using
    electric fish to teach evolutionary principles.

  description: >-
    Graduate seminar on the conceptual, theoretical, and empirical foundations of evolution.
    Student-led discussions of classic and current papers culminate in synthesis essays
    and presentations. Threads include selection, macroevolution, behavioral evolution,
    and genomics—always with an eye toward framing testable hypotheses.

  description: >-
    Active-learning course emphasizing modern genetics and genomics. A signature lab module
    guides students through RNA interference in C. elegans targeting homologs of human
    disease genes, with imaging and data interpretation. Weekly discussions connect development
    to society (e.g., teratogens and environmental justice).

  description: >-
    Weekly journal club on next-generation sequencing and study design for grads, postdocs,
    and faculty. Participants present methods/papers and write short digests. Topics span
    RNA-seq, variant calling, long-read/Oxford Nanopore, workflow best practices, and
    leveraging MSU HPCC resources.
