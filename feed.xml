<p>Rita’s poster, entitled “WHAT’S ON THE MENU? DIET DIVERSITY IN RAPIDLY SPECIATING GROUPS OF WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH” examined gut content biodiversity in Paramormyrops electric fish we collected from Gabon in 2019, and she’ll be working with us over the summer to write up these exciting results soon!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congratulations to Rita Gorsuch, on receiving first place in the Cell Biology, Genetics and Genomics category at the 2025 MSU UURAF!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Alyssa and Ella @ Girls Math and Science Day</title><link href="https://efish.integrativebiology.msu.edu/2025/03/05/GMSD25.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Alyssa and Ella @ Girls Math and Science Day" /><published>2025-03-05T01:50:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-20T00:27:50+00:00</updated><id>https://efish.integrativebiology.msu.edu/2025/03/05/GMSD25</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://efish.integrativebiology.msu.edu/2025/03/05/GMSD25.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/GMSD25.png" alt="/people/alyssa/" /></p>

<p>MSU GMSD is an opportunity for middle school students to work with enthusiastic and knowledgeable scientists at MSU to experience a variety of science fields through activities and demonstrations. Alyssa and Ella were active in organizing and actually participating in the event! So glad to have them participating in these events!</p>

Congratulations to Alyssa Saunders, PhD student in the MSU Electric Fish Lab, on receiving the 2025 Graduate Student Award for Science Communication and Outreach from MSU’s Office of Outreach and Engagement!</p>

<p>This prestigious award recognizes Alyssa’s creative and impactful efforts to connect science with diverse audiences—from organizing Biology on Tap and science panels at pop culture conventions, to hosting events on animal behavior at the Constellation Cat Café, and designing crochet patterns of model organisms.</p>

<p>She’s also engaged K–12 students through local school science nights and GMSD, and shared her research on podcasts like The Sci-Files and Journeys of Scientists. Alyssa recently brought her passion for advocacy to Washington, D.C., attending the AAAS Catalyzing Advocacy in Science and Engineering workshop.</p>

<p>Her work exemplifies the power of combining science, creativity, and public engagement—congratulations, Alyssa!</p>
