This terrific work was led by SofishPicq and features behavior work by BruceCarlson75 https: t.co B1zmAiD96a mdash; jasongallant jasongallant April 13, 2020Communication signals serve crucial survival and reproductive functions. In Gabon, the widely distributed mormyrid fish Paramormyrops kingsleyae emits an electric organ discharge EOD signal with a dual role in communication and electrolocation that exhibits remarkable variation: populations of P. kingsleyae have either biphasic or triphasic EODs, a feature that characterizes interspecific signal diversity among the Paramormyrops genus. We quantified variation in EODs of 327 P. kingsleyae from nine populations and compared it to genetic variation estimated from microsatellite loci. We found no correlation between electric signal and genetic distances, suggesting that EOD divergence cannot be explained by drift alone. An alternative hypothesis is that EOD differences are used for mate discrimination, which would require P. kingsleyae be capable of differentiating between divergent EOD waveforms. Using a habituation dishabituation assay, we found that P. kingsleyae can discriminate between biphasic and triphasic EOD types. Nonetheless, patterns of genetic and electric organ morphology divergence provide evidence for hybridization between these signal types. Although reproductive isolation with respect to signal type is incomplete, our results suggest that EOD variation in P. kingsleyae could be a cue for assortative mating.Check out the full paper here:https: onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 evo.13953">

      <p data-search="Electric fish have served as a model system in biology since the 18th century, providing insight into the nature of bioelectrogenesis, the structure of the synapse, and brain circuitry underlying complex behavior. Electric fishes exhibit many interesting characteristics or phenotypes, but very little is known about how these phenotypes are encoded in the genetic material or genome. Understanding this relation is a broad goal in 21st century biology. Electric fish offer a singular advantage in trying to understand the link between the genome and the phenotype it produces: two groups of electric fish evolved independently in Africa and South America, providing a system where biologists of all stripes can attack genotype-phenotype questions with built-in replication. There is a growing amount of electric fish genomic data; however, there are no functional tools to investigate this connection. The purpose of this project is to develop a robust, accessible, and easily transferable genetic manipulation toolbox for the electric fish model system full range of questions under investigation, regardless of a researchers background. The first phase of the project is rapid parallel protocol development, and the second phase of the project will be to disseminate knowledge gained by developing web-based software for sharing protocols, data, and resources, and to train the next generation of electric fish biologists undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds in the use of these techniques in preparation for careers in science and technology.The proposed project, is divided into two phases. The first phase of the project is rapid parallel protocol development, with the specific aims to: 1 generate stable mutant and transgenic lines of electric fish using CRISPR Cas9 technologies, 2 express transgenic material using viral-mediated techniques, and 3 knockdown specific endogenous gene activity using morpholinos. The second phase of the project is dissemination of knowledge and community infrastructure improvement, with the specific aims to: 1 establish and distribute genomic resources and tools that enable the community to target genes of interest and 2 disseminate protocols developed in Phase 1 by broadening participation in the field and training the next generation of electric fish biologists to harness these powerful new techniques. The project accelerates significantly research on genotype-phenotype interaction across the full range of NSF-IOS priority areas because it combines the power of genomic manipulation and a globally accessible model system with extensive phenotypic data that span biological levels of analysis from molecules to populations. Examples of such studies include: 1 insight into ion channel function 2 identification of transduction molecules in electrosensory systems, 3 identification of developmental mechanisms governing the repeated evolution of electroreceptors and electric organs, 5 optogenetics-enabled dissections of brain circuits 6 link genetic changes and the evolution of reproductive isolation. An outcome of this project is the enablement of the electric fish community to develop new and exciting hypotheses and projects spanning the gamut of biological disciplines, and act as ambassadors to other non-canonical model systems to apply newly developed techniques.">

Watching dad for a few minutes revealed a very interesting behavior whenever a fry which at this early stage are quite pathetic swimmers managed to get away from the nest, Dad would come by and scoop him it up in his mouth. Initially, I thought that he was eating the eggs, but then I witnessed that after a minute or so, he would swim back to his nest and spit it back out Armed with my iPhone, I got some video of the pickup behavior. Most of the time, he put the eggs where I couldn t video record, so the video represents the pickup of one egg and the dropoff of another:This morning, Monica and I found many more fresh eggs we took them up to count, and then returned a portion to the tank in a petri dish to see what the father would do about 50 all told. We left the lights off for about 2 hours, and when I came back, all of the eggs were tucked safely back in the nest Truly impressive behavior">

      <p data-search="I ve been running an experiment trying to implement AWS in some of our bioinformatics projects. After surveying some nice reviews Yandell and Ence, 2012 , I ve decided on the MAKER pipeline to get things started. The basic approach will be to take orthologous proteins from other organisms, together with existing transcriptome data assembled by cufflinks , and use this as a means of pulling out putative coding regions to train an ab-inito gene predictor such as SNAP or Augustus to build gene models. Given the numerous BLAST steps that are involved in aligning this data, as well as processing it, the folks in the Yandell lab made MAKER parallel, through the use of either OpenMPI or MPICH2. Although we have an installation of the MAKER software on campus, it hasn t been updated in a while, and there is something of a queue run very long jobs with lots of processors I wondered if there were other options.Many folks have touted the virtues of using Amazon Web Services AWS for bioinformatics e.g. here it is great for making portable machines for bioinformatics analysis. For the uninitiated, AWS leases computing time to anyone with a credit card for the purposes of data crunching. It s tremendously handy, but bioinformaticians typically deploy only one machine for their analysis not very handy for taking advantage of the MPI capabilities of MAKER. Certainly, someone with a strong background in computer science or programming could set up a cluster using AWS, but who has the time Some quick googling uncovered a tremendous software package called, Starcluster, essentially a script that takes all of the pain out of this process. It s software written by folks at MIT, and with some minor edits to a configuration file, you can get your own cluster up and running in a matter of minutes.What follows is an assembly of links and advice in getting MAKER running on AWS. The system that I ve been able to assemble through a lot of trial and error works fairly reliably on large eukaryotic genomes. By my estimation, a full run including repeat masking, protein BLASTs, ab-inito gene prediction, etc. takes about 7-8 hours on 200 nodes with 4 processors each. Not too shabby.Step 1: Set up Starcluster and Amazon EC2Rather than reinvent the wheel, check out Wes Kendall s awesome tutorial on how to set up AWS and Starcluster to launch your first cluster.http: mpitutorial.com launching-an-amazon-ec2-mpi-cluster Starcluster also maintains a quick start guide that is also quite nice if you d like to follow that instead, though it lacks the information about getting set up with AWS, if you ve never used it before.http: star.mit.edu cluster docs latest quickstart.htmlOnce you ve started and terminated your first cluster, come back here and we will play with the config files.Step 2: Set up region and data volumesYou ll want to put your data somewhere the instances that you will create have what is called ephemeral storage, meaning that the memory is cleared each time the computer is started up. To keep your data, you ll have to create a volume to store it. EC2 makes this very easy. Go to your EC2 dashboard, and click on Volumes under Elastic Block Store. Click Create Volume at the top. Choose a General Purpose SSD drive, and request an appropriate size you ll want to be able to accommodate the size of the data that you are using in MAKER, as well as the output data. My data drive is 300GB, which is more than ample room probably overkill . Pricing is per GB, and varies regionally. The information on pricing is located here. You ll also want to choose an availability zone to work within EBS volumes are not accessible outside their availability zone. Remember the availability zone that you choose for your data volume it matters not . When you click create you ll be returned to a list of the volumes you ve created when the creation process is complete, you ll be able to name your volume something descriptive e.g. data . Note the volume ID.Next, you ll want starcluster to play nicely with your newly created volume. To do this, you simply need to edit the availability zone settings of your cluster by editing the configuration file:AWS REGION NAME us-east-1d this matches the availability zone of your data volumeAWS REGION HOST ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com this is found by looking on AWS link below The region hosts are maintained on this list by Amazon.Step 3: Configure MPI and Install MAKER onto an AMIWith that out of the way, we must now get down to the business of running MAKER on your new cluster. To start with, we want install MAKER on our machine. A nice overview of the process is located here:http: star.mit.edu cluster docs 0.93.3 manual create new ami.htmlFirst we determine the available images which contain all of the stuff that makes starcluster run - at the time of publication, this is what starcluster list public gives us: starcluster listpublicStarCluster - http: star.mit.edu cluster v. 0.95.6 Software Tools for Academics and Researchers STAR Please submit bug reports to starcluster mit.edu gt; gt; gt; Listing all public StarCluster images...32bit Images:------------- 0 ami-9bf9c9f2 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-13.04-x86 EBS 1 ami-7c5c3915 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-12.04-x86 EBS 2 ami-899d49e0 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-11.10-x86 EBS 3 ami-8cf913e5 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-10.04-x86-rc3 4 ami-d1c42db8 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-9.10-x86-rc864bit Images:-------------- 0 ami-3393a45a us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-13.04-x86 64 EBS 1 ami-6b211202 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-13.04-x86 64-hvm HVM-EBS 2 ami-52a0c53b us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-12.04-x86 64-hvm HVM-EBS 3 ami-765b3e1f us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-12.04-x86 64 EBS 4 ami-4583572c us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-11.10-x86 64-hvm HVM-EBS 5 ami-999d49f0 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-11.10-x86 64 EBS 6 ami-0af31963 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-10.04-x86 64-rc1 7 ami-2faa7346 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-10.04-x86 64-qiime-1.4.0 EBS 8 ami-8852a0e1 us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-10.04-x86 64-hadoop 9 ami-a5c42dcc us-east-1d starcluster-base-ubuntu-9.10-x86 64-rc4 10 ami-06a75a6f us-east-1d starcluster-base-centos-5.4-x86 64-ebs-hvm-gpu-hadoop-rc2 HVM-EBS 11 ami-12b6477b us-east-1d starcluster-base-centos-5.4-x86 64-ebs-hvm-gpu-rc2 HVM-EBS total images: 17The first 64-bit image should work perfectly fine for our purposes. Noting the AMI number ami-3393a45a , we will tell starcluster to start a one-node cluster for us to download our software on. We ll use an m1.xlarge machine for this, although it doesn t really matter so long as it is a 64-bit machine.starcluster start -s 1 -i m1.xlarge -n ami-3393a45a software installOnce starcluster is done, you can connect with the following command:starcluster sshmaster software installIt is important to note at this time that you are logged in as the root user when connecting by this method. The root user s home directory root is NOT shared via NFS to other nodes on the system, which means trouble for using MPI with your installed programs. The home folder of the cluster user set in your configuration file by default to be sgeadmin is, however shared by NFS. That s where you want to put MAKER. Go to the following website to register and obtain the download link for MAKER:http: yandell.topaz.genetics.utah.edu cgi-bin maker license.cgiOnce you ve obtained the download link,cd home sgeadmin wget http: link.to maker software you obtain the link by registering with MAKERtar -zxvf maker-2.31.8.tgzNext, there seems to be a bit of a bug with the MPI installation using the current base AMI which should be OpenMPI by default . To set this properly:update-alternatives --config mpiThis will give you the following menu. You will want to choose 2 OpenMPI .There are 2 choices for the alternative mpi providing usr include mpi . Selection Path Priority Status------------------------------------------------------------ 0 usr include mpich2 40 auto mode 1 usr include mpich2 40 manual mode 2 usr lib openmpi include 40 manual modePress enter to keep the current choice , or type selection number: lt;span style background-color: f4f4f4; gt;2 lt; span gt;Now that OpenMPI is set, you ll want to get the path to the libmpi.so for OpenMPI. Verify this by typing update-alternatives --display mpi... usr lib openmpi include - priority 40 slave libmpi .so: usr lib openmpi lib libmpi cxx.so slave libmpi.so: usr lib openmpi lib libmpi.so slave libmpif77.so: usr lib openmpi lib libmpi f77.so slave libmpif90.so: usr lib openmpi lib libmpi f90.so slave mpiCC: usr bin mpic .openmpi slave mpiCC.1.gz: usr share man man1 mpiCC.openmpi.1.gz slave mpic : usr bin mpic .openmpi slave mpic .1.gz: usr share man man1 mpic .openmpi.1.gz slave mpicc: usr bin mpicc.openmpi slave mpicc.1.gz: usr share man man1 mpicc.openmpi.1.gz slave mpicxx: usr bin mpic .openmpi slave mpicxx.1.gz: usr share man man1 mpicxx.openmpi.1.gz slave mpif77: usr bin mpif77.openmpi slave mpif77.1.gz: usr share man man1 mpif77.openmpi.1.gz slave mpif90: usr bin mpif90.openmpi slave mpif90.1.gz: usr share man man1 mpif90.openmpi.1.gzWe can see here that the path to libmpi.so is: usr lib openmpi lib libmpi.so . You ll need to set some environment variables next, before you go any further. Open .bashrc with your favorite text editor and add the following lines at the bottom:export LD PRELOAD usr lib openmpi lib libmpi.soexport MPI MCA mpi warn on fork 0Close your .bashrc file and reload it by typing the following:source .bashrcNow we re ready to rock You should be able to install Maker by following the standard build instructions included in the distribution:cd home sgeadmin maker srcperl Build.PL Follow command prompts. Choose Y for Maker for MPI, and use default paths for MPI.. Build install deps. Build installexes Note that you ll have to register at repbase in order to download the repeatmasker libraries. Build installYou should now have a working installation of MAKER Once you re satisfied that everything is installed correctly, you ll want to save the image in order to use it on your cluster. Go to the AWS EC2 control panel, and click on Instances . Select your master node from the list, and click Actions gt;Image gt;Create Image . Give your image a name and description, and click Create Image . Note that any volumes attached to the machine will also be imaged by default. You can remove these safely to make the smallest image possible click the little x s .Once the image is completed, you ll be able to find the AMI id under Images gt;AMIs .Step 4: Configure Your ClusterYou re going to want to make some changes to the starcluster configuration file. Cluster configuration is based on a template system which is fully extensible, which means you don t have to retype all of the configuration options, only the ones you want to change. We ll base our new template on the default small cluster template. Inside your Additional Cluster Templates section, add the following: cluster makercluster EXTENDS smallclusterCLUSTER SIZE 200NODE IMAGE ID XX insert the AMI ID number for the instance containing your MAKER installationNODE INSTANCE TYPE m1.xlargeVOLUMES dataDISABLE QUEUE TrueIn addition, you ll want to tell starcluster where to find your EBS data volume that you created earlier. In the configuration file, find the Configuring EBS Volumes section in your config file and add the following: volume data VOLUME ID volume ID for your EBS data volumeMOUNT PATH mnt dataYou re ready to rock Step 5: Setup Your ClusterNotes on Hardware and PricingFirst things first, you ll want to select the hardware known as an instance that you ll be making your cluster out of. The specs and pricing per hour are located here:http: aws.amazon.com ec2 pricing This can be somewhat overwhelming at first but worry not For my experimentation purposes, I ve been using m1.xlarge resources, which feature four virtual CPUs, about 15GB of RAM and decent network performance. You can get pretty crazy with RAM and CPUs, but this typically suffices. Feel free to play with this as you see fit You have the option of paying the listed reserved rates, meaning that as long as you want to use the machine, it s yours But, as scientists with ever shrinking grant funds, sometimes its a good idea to minimize costs whenever possible. Enter Amazon s Spot Pricing . Here you can bid on computing time, and so long as your bid is not exceeded, you can use the resources you request. There is a bit of an art to selecting the proper price so your jobs don t die but thankfully Amazon does the hard work of finding out what historical pricing has been. To figure this out for your desired hardware, StarCluster makes it pretty easy to check:starcluster spothistory -p m1.largeWhich will open up a webpage with pricing over the last 30 days, as well as print a summary of the pertinent information to your terminal: gt; gt; gt; Fetching spot history for m1.large VPC gt; gt; gt; Current price: 0.0161 gt; gt; gt; Max price: 1.5000 gt; gt; gt; Average price: 0.0743So, were you to bid on these computers, you would pay 0.0161 per instance per hour a significant savings off the current reserved price of 0.175 per Hour about 10 the price in fact . If demand for these computers shoots up as you can see happens periodically from your graph , pricing goes up. If your bid exceeds the current price, you get to keep running at the new price. If not, your instance is closed. The trick is to make a bid that is high enough to keep your jobs running typically, I ve been working at approximately double the current price, and that seems to work fairly well.Launch your cluster with the following command. Remember, we ve set a 200-node cluster in our configuration file. The -b flag sets your bid price, and the -c tells starcluster to use your makercluster template. Because there are so many nodes, this might take a while starcluster start -c makercluster -b 0.04 makerclusterOnce everything is started up, you are ready to run Maker. You can upload data from your personal hard drive to the mnt data storage area by the following:starcluster put makercluster mnt data local path to datafileOnce you ve uploaded your data, go ahead and login to your master node:starcluster sshmaster makerclusterStart a directory for your maker data to live in, then the following to generate your Maker control files. home sgeadmin maker bin maker -CTLSet options according to this website:http: weatherby.genetics.utah.edu MAKER wiki index.php The MAKER control files explainedSpecifically for your maker cluster, you want to reduce the chunk size of the DNA to be more RAM-efficient and set the temporary directory to be a location specific to each node, rather than using NFS which slows things down and creates headaches . In the maker opts.ctl file, set the following options:max dna len 50000TMP scratch sgeadmin Finally, you ll have to generate a hosts file so that OpenMPI knows how to farm out the jobs:cat etc hostsWhich looks like:127.0.0.1 localhost The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopbackfe00::0 ip6-localnetff00::0 ip6-mcastprefixff02::1 ip6-allnodesff02::2 ip6-allroutersff02::3 ip6-allhosts172.31.27.144 masterCopy this to a text editor, and remove all of the lines prior to the line containing master . Remove all IP addresses, so that the following list looks like the following:masternode001node002...Save this text file as hosts.txt in the maker output directory.Once you re satisfied that everything is correctly setup, you should be able to run MAKER with a command like the following:mpirun -x LD PRELOAD -x OMPI MCA mpi warn on fork -n 200 -hostfile hosts.txt -tag-output maker bin maker -cpus 4 2 gt; amp;1 tee maker log.txtHappy annotating">

You can see one of our new eggs here, about 14 hours after fertilization.In fish, development is discoidal meaning that the entire egg doesn t divide, rather a thin layer of cells on the top of the egg this portion is called the blastodisc. The cells of the developing fish are located in the upper right hand portion of the image. As development continues, this layer of cells will flatten and eventually encircle the yolk of the egg. As the cells divide more and more, they start to move or epiboly toward the bottom of the egg through a process known as gastrulation. Lewis Wolpert famously said It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time in your life. How true As this process moves to about halfway down the cell in a few hours, the cells that will eventually become all major organ systems will have begun to differentiate. Eventually, the blastula will complete epiboly sometime tomorrow morning, and the first signs of a discernible fish will be visible.Stay tuned">

      <p data-search="I ve now realized that the build in UNIX text editor nano just doesn t cut the mustard, so I m switching to VIM. So far, I like it though it is a little hard for a fervent nano amp; sublime text editor to get used to. But, there are some ways to tweak it to get it feeling a bit more familiar. Create a text file in your home directory called .vimrc that reads as following: set mouse aset number Save the file and fire up vim. Now you have a mouse scrolling text editor, with line numbers Already better than nano My installation on BU s Katana Cluster has syntax highlighting enabled by default.. but it looked wierd compared to my usual sublime text background. I m using iTerm2 MacOSX , so it supports 256 colors. This enables me to use a rich color scheme. To prepare, I have to add the following to bash profile: TERM xterm-256color; export TERM Next, I had to create a user .vim directory, and somewhere to put the color schemes I download. Vim looks in HOME .vim colors: mkdir .vimmkdir .vim colors Download the color scheme you like sublime text is closely emulated by . Then, going back to my .vimrc file: set mouse aset numbersyntax enablecolorscheme molokaiset background dark Now, open up your favorite script and behold the sublime-text like color scheme If you want to copy and paste from the VIM window in your terminal, you can disable the vim mouse mode by pressing option.">

After some mashing together and trial and error, I came up with a code that will count the number of 1 s and 0 s in a column seperated file in this case, from column 3 and 4 respectively from the file .
